This study investigates how menstrual cycle phases (early follicular, pre-ovulatory, mid-luteal), hormone levels (estradiol, progesterone), and age impact whole-brain and resting-state network (RSN) node-metastability in a cohort of 60 healthy women.

## Purpose & Scope

- Quantify changes in whole-brain dynamical complexity using node-metastability metrics.
- Examine effects of hormonal fluctuations (estradiol, progesterone) and age via multilevel modelling.
- Characterize dynamics across large-scale RSN: DMN, somatomotor, control, dorsal attention, limbic, salience, subcortical, visual.
- Aid precision neuroscience studies within neuroendocrinology and womenâ€™s brain health.

---

## Repository Structure

- `Ignition_SingleSubject.m`: Core MATLAB script computing node-metastability (ignition) per subject.

> **Note:** For privacy, no empirical data is includedâ€”use your own preprocessed datasets.

---

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2018a or later
- Preprocessed resting-state fMRI scans (in time series format)
- Hormonal data and age for each subject

---

## Usage Guide

1. Clone this repository and open it in MATLAB.
2. Run `Ignition_SingleSubject.m`.
